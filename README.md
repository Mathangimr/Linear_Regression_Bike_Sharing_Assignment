## General Information
- BoomBikes is a US bike-sharing provider which provides bike sharing service to the individuals on a short term basis. The users generally get the bike from the dock, since it is computer controlled, payment is done online and they can return the bike after usage at another dock of their system. 
- Background - To build Linear regression model to identify 
	* Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
	* How well those variables describe the bike demands
- Business Problem - The aim of this case study is to identify which features affect the bike-sharing service so that we can use those features to growth the business and meet customer's expectations. This is identified by building model using Linear Regression which helps us in giving the significant factors.

## Conclusions
- The temperature should be considered as it plays a major role whether the customer would avail the service or not.
- Similarly, weather plays an important role in order to have a higher demand.
- Months between June to October have the highest demands, hence company should strategize their services during this time.
- Specifically during Fall and Summer, company should be able to serve high requests in order to increase their business.
- Also, take into the consideration of working days and holidays, because the booking is less in holidays which is reasonable.
